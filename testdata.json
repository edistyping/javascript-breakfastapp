I hope you enjoy this easy, and delicious Bulgogi Beef Recipe!\n\nIngredients:\nFood Wishes Video Recipes: Bulgogi Beef – How They “Barbecue” in Korea (the Good Korea)\nTuesday, September 27, 2016\nBulgogi Beef – How They “Barbecue” in Korea (the Good Korea)\nThis is going to be a pretty easy post to write, since I\nknow almost nothing about the fine art of bulgogi. I do know that if you follow\nalong with what I did in the video, you're going to end up with something very\ndelicious, and fairly gorgeous, so that's a good place to start.\nI also know that you can control the texture by making your\nslices thicker or thinner, as well as changing the marination time. Obviously,\nthe thinner the slice, and the longer it's in the marinade, the softer and more\ntender the meat becomes. However, you\ncan go too far, ending up with something mushy, and unappetizing.\nUnfortunately, this is a matter of trial and error, and so\nto avoid all that, I generally go with just an hour or two, which always seems\nlike plenty to me. I don't want mushy\nmeat, in the best examples I've had of this in Korean restaurants, while\ntender, still had a little bit of chewiness to them. Besides, the fact that\nthis is such a fast-acting marinade, is one of the big advantages.\nIf you don't do the boneless short ribs, and go with pork\nloin, or chicken, you'll want to be especially careful, since it has less\nconnective tissue. By the way, if you are an experienced bulgogi master, please\nfeel free to pass any tips along. I really hope to give this a try soon.
