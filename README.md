# Korean Food!

### To Do 

+ Find an API for korean receipts 
    - Might have to create my own. If so, just find like 20 receipts

+ Decide how to fetch+display next contents 
    - Can we load more data as we scroll down without using j-Query? 

+ Filter by spicyness
    - Number of ingrendts 
    - Main general ingredeints use 


### Finished
+ Get 3 grid boxes to have fixed width size
    => Done by using 'fr'
