### Test 

1. Get 3 grid boxes to have fixed width size
    => Done by using 'fr' 

2. Find an API for korean receipts 
    - Might have to create my own. If so, just find like 20 receipts

3. Decide how to fetch+display next contents 
    - Can we load more data as we scroll down without using j-Query? 

4. Filter by spicyness
    - Number of ingrendts 
    - Main general ingredeints use
